# XPath31

The files in this directory are generated from the XPath31.g4 file. Bazel correctly generates these files in the build
sandbox. Unfortunately I have not worked out how to make these files available when using go to resolve the dependency.
Ideally the packaging for release would take care of blending the two source trees into one. If you are reading this
and know the answer or how this should be done please drop a note in the discussions' area.
